Formal Semantics for Why3

This repo contains a formalization of the logic fragment of the [why3](https://why3.lri.fr/) language, 
used as a backend for many verification tools, including [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/).

Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre's 2013 paper [One Logic To Use Them All](https://why3.lri.fr/download/cade2013.pdf) describes the logic behind why3
(a polymorphic first-order logic).
