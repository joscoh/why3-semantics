## A Verified Compiler From P-FOLDR to Polymorphic FOL
- `eliminate_inductive` - axiomatize inductive predicates with constructor axioms and inversion
- `eliminate_definition` - axiomatize recursive functions and predicates with unfolding lemma
- `compile_match` - reduce pattern matches to simple patterns (decision trees)
- `eliminate_algebraic` - first-order axiomatization of ADTs and pattern matching
- `eliminate_let` - eliminate let-bindings via substitution
