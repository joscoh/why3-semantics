(*We want to lift a (list (m A)) to a m (list A) for a monad m.
  We can do this in 3 ways:
  1. Use typeclasses
  2. Give a generic function that takes in bind and return
  3. Write the same function for each monad
  Unfortunately, the first 2 ways give horrible OCaml code
  full of Object.magic and that can easily not compile
  (we need non-prenex polymorphism).
  So we do the third (for now)*)
(*Just so we don't have to write it 3 times*)
(*Of course in OCaml, these all reduce to the identity function*)
