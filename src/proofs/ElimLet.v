(*An example of how to prove soundness of stateful functions:

We use a version of [eliminate_let], as implemented in proofs/transform/eliminate_let.v.
Notably, this is NOT why3's version (which we proved sound), which has a nontrivial 
termination argument. Instead, we substitute only on subterms. Also, it only eliminates
let-bindings in goals, not elsewhere, this simplifies things a bit.
The primary proof goal is to relate stateless and stateful substitution (which is
really the primary difference between the two layers) so it does encompass the main
difficulties.
